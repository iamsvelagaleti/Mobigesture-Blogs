# IVR Application Testing

In the modern era of technology, for any issues being faced in the services provided by an organization, customers wish to get the solution online or resolve the issues either by making few clicks or with a simple call. This is made possible with IVR application and we are able to learn **"How IVR works?** in the previous discussion. To be successful in its implementation, It is is always good to have the best organisation suited CX design to meet customers requirements with huge ROI. Similarly, it is very important to evaluate the developed application before its the release into the market. 

To evaluate and test the any IVR application, there is a simple base flow to be followed as show in below.

In order to manually test the application, the tester need to be place a call the the test servers and respond to the same repeated prompts and respond with all options to follow a test case scenario which is a tedious task. Thus, testing the IVR application is not only boring and stressful but also time taking.

There are tools available in the market which in turn will ease the job of a tester. These automation tools, will emulate the behaviour of the call center environment and test the behaviour of the application. This emulation is so similar to the call center as it can resolve all the features like call pick-up, hang-up, respond, collect inputs etc.

Surprised? on how the manual behaviour can be replicated by machine. On observation on above test case implementation with IVR application infrastructure, we can identify that all the calls are being handled with the help of SIP. So, by taking advantage of SIP, such ability has be acquired by these below test tools.

<u>**Benefits:**</u>

- End to End call testing
- Lower probability of releasing critical defects into production
- Reusable test scenarios on different kinds of testing
- Customizable based on requirements
- Omni channel implementation is possible
- Comparatively low cost option in the domain 

**<u>Drawbacks:</u>**

- learning curve to implement scenarios
- No support on configuration problem identification
- No coverage on performance analysis of the hardware



## Hammer

Hammer was developed by Empirix. It identifies experience related issues, performance issues, configuration problems, jittering etc. It is a sophisticated tool for test development, debug and reporting during the entire testing lifecycle.
