# omni-channel testing vs multi-channel testing

Now-a-days enterprises are aiming to bring in unified experience across multiple platforms and devices to bring more acceptance among their customers. QA and testing teams play a major role to ensure all the aspects and features work in collaboration with each other to give the desired user experience. 

So, it is always important to make sure testing is always intertwined with development process and cannot be an after thought. DevOps and Agile approaches has got an exponential increase in adaptation by enterprises to enable these parameters. 

Known fact, "customer experience and needs are expected to bring business growth", and to ensure such business-driven parameters to be tested, recent pointers are to "Omni-channel" and "Multi-channel" testing. 

The major difference between these two methodologies lies in the process of testing the application. **"Omni-channel"** testing is performed on the same application across multiple devices for seamless user experience, wherein **"Multi-channel"** testing is executed on the similar tasks on a range of devices to determine any issues in cohesion.

## Key differences

1. **Difference in implementation**

   Feature/task to be tested on multiple devices then Multi-channel is considered. When an application has be tested and it can be applied on multiple devices, then Omni-channel testing is considered. 

   For example, if website to be tested on responsiveness across multiple devices like mobile, desktop etc. "multi-channel" is opted. On the other hand, if an IVR application call flow is being tested and call flow can be answered through different mediums, then "omni-channel" testing is considered



2. **User vs Device Approach**

   multi-channel testing focuses on its experience in relation to multiple devices whereas omni-channel testing focus is on seamless user experience.

   For instance, in multi-channel testing, single feature will be tested on all devices and a report is generated. If the focus is on to testing for similar experience on all devices it is called omni-channel testing



3. **Enterprise-level Approach**

   In multi-channel, focus will on exploiting the performance, wherein omni-channel testing focus will be on customer to get the similar experience on all different devices available.



4. **Customer-Engagement Strategy**

   Multi-channel approach is when companies use multiple platforms to engage and offer the same services to the customers. Omni-channel approach is where companies to consider that the customers might initiate an activity on one platform and eventually move on with another platform for various possible reasons, even then they get the similar experience.



5. **Consistency of experience**

   Omni-channel approach is all about offering a seamless and consistent experience for the customers across channels. The devices can differ, but the experience has to be the same, with same touchpoints across channels. Omnichannel testing is a key approach that is adopted for retail, where brands and retailers are interested in giving seamless and consistent experience to the customers.

   Multi-channel testing believes in bringing consistency, but the approach is to create unique experience across channels/devices. So, the objectives for creating consistency will differ.



All in all, customers are the key and core for Digital Transformation, their preferences will keep on define and redefine the industry approach. So, adopting a Multi-channel or Omni-channel testing approach will depend on the industry/domain it is being implemented for. To illustrate, a retail player like VHTCX will consider Omni-channel testing approach, while a bank will consider a multi-channel approach to test its banking application.
